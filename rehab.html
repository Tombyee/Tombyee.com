My Journey of hope and Transformation
</H3>

<p> 
Iam <b>Kombodo Bakhit Abdalla,</b> also known as (Tombyee). <mark><i>Tombyee</i></mark> was born in <i>1998</i> in a small, humble village called <b>Umdrafi,</b> nestled within the scenic yet war-stricken Nuba Mountains of Sudan. My early life shaped by simplicity and resilience. I began my academic journey at <b>Umdrafi primary school</b> in <sup>2005,</sup> laying a strong foundation for my education withe hope and determination.

However, in 2013, my dreams were disrupted by the outbreak of war and growing      insecurity in our region. The confli ct made it impossible to continue schooling, forcing my family to make a heartbreaking dedision - to relocate me to a safer place  where i could continue my education. On may<sup> 11, 2013,</sup> i arrived in Kenya and was registered by <b> UNHCR </b> as a refugee in kakuma refugee camp.
</p>

<p>
At the, adjusting to life in he camp- sudrrounded by people from different culture and backgrounds-was overwhelming. But i quickly adapted, driven by the strong desire to continue my education. I enrolleda at palotaka prinaary school in the refugee camp, and despite the challenges, I remained committed to my goals with resilience and faith. 
</p>
In 2019, I proudly completed my secondary education. It was major milestone, but it aslo market the beginning of a new, transformative chapter. I joined Donbosco Technical Institute in Kakuma, a center that offers free vocational trainig to the refugees through the funding by UNHCR. This opportunity became a turning point in my life.

Though I initially struggled to keep pace with the curricullum,  I ws deeply inspired by the dedication of Donbosco instructors and the advanced training equipment available. I began to nurture a growing interest in computer techology and visual media. Through hands-on courses in computer applications and printing, I discovered my hidden talents and developed verstile skills in the field of digital production.
<br></br>
In 2023, I was selected for an internship at <link> <b>Donbosco printing press </b> </link> as a graphic designer. This practical experience signigicantly my skills and deepened my understanding of design and digital work. I gained confidence, professionalism, and a renewed sense of purpose.
<p>
Upon completing my internship in 2024, Donbosco offered me a position in their logistics department. Today, I proudly serve in that role, applying the technical and digital skills I acquired through my training. I now work with inventory systems and logistics support, and Iam also able to support my family- both hee in kenya and back in sudan.
</p>
Throughout this journey, the role of <b>UNHCR</b> and <b>Don Bosco</b> has been monumental. <b>UNHCR </b>gave me a second chance at life-safety, protection, and access to education in a time of deep uncertainty.Don Bosco empowered me with practical skills, mentorship, and opportunities that i never imagined possible. These institutions have not only shaped my career but also my character, teaching me the values of responsibility, hard work, and service to others.<br></br>

Thanks to their unwavering suooort, i have grown both professionally and personally. I now dream of starting my own business and using my knowledge to empower other youth in my community. I believe in sharing what i'v learned and helping others rise above challenges ass i did.
my journey has taught me that success is not born of comfort, but of sacrifice, discipline, and unshakable commitment. For over four years, I was unemployee - but i never gave up. I kept preparing, learning and believing . Today, i am working, supporting my family, and moving forward with purpose. 

<h4>To anyone facing hardship, I say this:</h4>

<p>

<i>
"A successful future is not possible without sacrifice and unwavering deaication. Life becomes meaningful when you commit to your goals and take bold steps toward growth. Your destiny is in your hands - only you can decide the kind of life you want to lead. No path is free of obstacles, but perseverance is the key that unlocks progress."

<p>
I am deeply greatful to <b>UNHCR</b> and <b>Donbosco Kakuma</b> for the life-changing opportunities they gave me. Because of them, I have found meaning, courage, and direction in life. With determination and the right suppot, anyone- even a young boy from Umdrafi- can shape a better future.
